# Flasheasy

Flasheasy is an intuitive SRS (Spaced Repetition System) flashcard web app designed to make learning English easier, smarter, and more human — powered by AI.

Originally built to help my girlfriend study English, this project focuses on simplicity, clarity, and actually helping learners progress without friction.

## 🚀 Why Flasheasy?

Most flashcard and SRS tools today fall into one of two categories:
- Powerful but complex and overwhelming  
- Simple but limited, paid, or with poor UX  

Flasheasy aims to sit in the sweet spot:
- Clean and intuitive interface  
- Science-based spaced repetition  
- AI features that *actually help*, not distract

## 🧩 Core Concepts

- **Spaced Repetition System (SRS)**  
  Review cards at the right time to improve long-term memory.

- **Flashcards made for language learning**  
  Vocabulary, phrases, sentences, and contextual usage.

- **AI-assisted learning**  
  Smart features to help explain, generate examples, and adapt study content to the learner.

---

## 🤖 Planned AI Features

- AI-generated example sentences based on the learner’s level  
- Simple explanations for words and phrases  
- Smart hints when a card is repeatedly failed  
- Automatic suggestion of new cards based on mistakes  

(Always optional. AI should support learning, not replace thinking.)

## ❤️ Philosophy

Learning a language is already hard.  
The tool shouldn’t make it harder.

Flasheasy Belle is about:
- Reducing friction  
- Encouraging consistency  
- Respecting the learner’s time and mental energy

## ✨ Final Note

This project started as something personal.  
If it helps more people along the way, even better.
